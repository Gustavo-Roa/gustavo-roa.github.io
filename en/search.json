    "text": "Research Focus\nMy research integrates field experimentation, greenhouse studies, and isotope tracer techniques to improve fertilizer recommendations and nutrient diagnostics in cropping systems. I work at the intersection of agronomy, soil chemistry, and data science to enhance phosphorus and sulfur use efficiency in corn, soybean, wheat, and sorghum systems in Kansas and beyond.\nCurrent research areas include:\n\nPhosphorus Management Strategies:\n\nLong-term P placement trials (18+ years)\nSoil test calibration and critical level updates for corn\nUse of plant tissue concentrations to support P recommendations\n\nSulfur Nutrition and Diagnostics:\n\nCorn response to S across multiple environments\nS uptake, efficiency indices, and diagnostic tool validation\nBiomass, SPAD, NDVI, and tissue analysis integration\n\n¬π‚ÅµN Isotopic Tracers in Agronomic Systems:\n\nGreenhouse and field trials evaluating fertilizer N recovery\nDifferentiating N from soil, fertilizer, and atmospheric sources\nContributing to methodological advances and best practices\n\nData Science & Modeling Applications:\n\nMachine learning for nutrient prediction\nDecision trees for fertilizer recommendations\nSensitivity analyses in erosion modeling with RUSLE + GEE\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching & Mentorship\nI believe in making science accessible and meaningful for students and stakeholders. My teaching experience spans formal education and community outreach:\n\nGuest Lab Instructor AGRON 305 ‚Äì Soils (Fall 2024) ‚Äì Kansas State University\nDelivered the Nutrient Management Lab and updated the associated manual under the supervision of Dr.¬†Colby Moorberg.\nSpanish Instructor (Volunteer) ‚Äì UFM Community Learning Center (2021‚Äì2024)\nTaught weekly classes to more than 30 adult learners to promote cultural exchange and community engagement.\nMentoring Undergraduate Interns ‚Äì Kansas State University\nSupervised students in lab and field settings, guiding them through sampling, analysis, and scientific writing.\nScientific Communication\nLed workshops as Chair of the Scientific Communication Committee (AGSA), improving graduate students‚Äô presentation and publishing skills.\nConference Participation\nModerated sessions at the SWCS International Annual Meeting, participated in ASA-CSSA-SSSA symposia, and regularly present research at national and international conferences.\n\n\n\n\nCollaboration & Outreach\n\nStrong collaboration with farmers, extension agents, and graduate committees to design and execute trials across &gt;40 site-years.\nExperience writing research proposals (e.g., Kansas Fertilizer Research Fund)\nFluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Guarani ‚Äî enabling engagement across diverse communities in the Americas.\n\n\n\n\nPeer-Review Activities\n\nServe as a reviewer for the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation (Soil and Water Conservation Society), evaluating submissions in soil fertility, nutrient management, and agronomic systems."
