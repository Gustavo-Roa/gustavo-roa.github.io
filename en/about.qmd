# About Me

I’m originally from Manta Potrero, a small town in Paraguay. I began my agricultural career at the San Francisco Agricultural School in Cerrito, Paraguay. Since then, I have earned degrees from EARTH University in Costa Rica, UnADM in Mexico (On line), and Kansas State University in the United States. Along this journey, I have learned from and contributed to a variety of agricultural projects across regions.
