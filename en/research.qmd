# Research Focus

My research integrates field experimentation, greenhouse studies, and isotope tracer techniques to improve fertilizer recommendations and nutrient diagnostics in cropping systems. I work at the intersection of agronomy, soil chemistry, and data science to enhance phosphorus and sulfur use efficiency in corn, soybean, wheat, and sorghum systems in Kansas and beyond.

**Current research areas include:**

-   **Phosphorus Management Strategies**:
    -   Long-term P placement trials (18+ years)
    -   Soil test calibration and critical level updates for corn
    -   Use of plant tissue concentrations to support P recommendations
-   **Sulfur Nutrition and Diagnostics**:
    -   Corn response to S across multiple environments
    -   S uptake, efficiency indices, and diagnostic tool validation
    -   Biomass, SPAD, NDVI, and tissue analysis integration
-   **¹⁵N Isotopic Tracers in Agronomic Systems**:
    -   Greenhouse and field trials evaluating fertilizer N recovery
    -   Differentiating N from soil, fertilizer, and atmospheric sources
    -   Contributing to methodological advances and best practices
-   **Data Science & Modeling Applications**:
    -   Machine learning for nutrient prediction
    -   Decision trees for fertilizer recommendations
    -   Sensitivity analyses in erosion modeling with RUSLE + GEE

# Teaching & Mentorship

I believe in making science accessible and meaningful for students and stakeholders. My teaching experience spans formal education and community outreach:

-   **Guest Lab Instructor** AGRON 305 – Soils (Fall 2024) – Kansas State University\
    Delivered the Nutrient Management Lab and updated the associated manual under the supervision of Dr. Colby Moorberg.

-   **Spanish Instructor (Volunteer)** – UFM Community Learning Center (2021–2024)\
    Taught weekly classes to more than 30 adult learners to promote cultural exchange and community engagement.

-   **Mentoring Undergraduate Interns** – Kansas State University\
    Supervised students in lab and field settings, guiding them through sampling, analysis, and scientific writing.

-   **Scientific Communication**\
    Led workshops as Chair of the Scientific Communication Committee (AGSA), improving graduate students' presentation and publishing skills.

-   **Conference Participation**\
    Moderated sessions at the SWCS International Annual Meeting, participated in ASA-CSSA-SSSA symposia, and regularly present research at national and international conferences.

# Collaboration & Outreach

-   Strong collaboration with **farmers**, **extension agents**, and **graduate committees** to design and execute trials across \>40 site-years.
-   Experience writing research proposals (e.g., Kansas Fertilizer Research Fund)
-   Fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Guarani — enabling engagement across diverse communities in the Americas.

# Peer-Review Activities

- Serve as a reviewer for the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation (Soil and Water Conservation Society), evaluating submissions in soil fertility, nutrient management, and agronomic systems.
