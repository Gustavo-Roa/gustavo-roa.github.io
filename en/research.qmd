# Research Focus

My research integrates field experimentation, greenhouse studies, and isotope tracer techniques to improve fertilizer recommendations and nutrient diagnostics in cropping systems. I work at the intersection of agronomy, soil chemistry, and data science to enhance phosphorus and sulfur use efficiency in corn, soybean, wheat, and sorghum systems in Kansas and beyond.

## Current research areas
::: {.panel-tabset}
### Phosphorus management
- Long-term P placement trials (18+ years)  
- Soil test calibration and critical level updates for corn  
- Plant tissue concentrations to support P recommendations  

### Sulfur nutrition & diagnostics
- Corn response to S across multiple environments  
- S uptake, efficiency indices, and diagnostic tool validation  
- Integrating biomass, SPAD, NDVI, and tissue analysis  

### ¹⁵N isotopic tracers
- Greenhouse and field trials evaluating fertilizer N recovery  
- Partitioning N from soil, fertilizer, and atmospheric sources  
- Methodological advances and best practices  

### Data science & modeling
- Bayesian statistics to improve fertilizer recommendations  
- ML for nutrient prediction; decision trees for recs  
- Mixed models and GAMs for long-term data  
- Sensitivity analyses in erosion modeling (RUSLE + GEE)
